# Integration of an IDS(snort) with a SIEM solution(splunk) for real-time security monitoring

## Objective
To implement a real-time security monitoring system by integrating Snort IDS with Splunk Enterprise through a Universal Forwarder, enabling centralized log collection, custom alerting, and interactive dashboards for effective intrusion detection and analysis.This setup helps monitor network activity more easily and allows quick detection and response to potential threats.

### Skills Learned
- Splunk Enterprise Installation and Configuration – Setting up and managing a SIEM platform for data ingestion and analysis.

- Splunk Universal Forwarder Deployment – Installing and configuring forwarders for remote log collection.

- Log Forwarding and Centralized Log Management – Sending and managing logs from different sources to a central SIEM.

- Snort IDS Installation and Configuration – Deploying an open-source intrusion detection system on Linux.

- SIEM and IDS Integration – Connecting Snort with Splunk to monitor security events in real time.

- Alert Creation in Splunk – Setting up custom alerts based on specific security events or log patterns.

- Dashboard Design in Splunk – Building visual dashboards for better monitoring and threat visibility.

- Basic Linux Administration – Managing Ubuntu VMs, installing packages, and configuring services.

- Security Monitoring and Threat Detection Concepts – Understanding how to detect and analyze suspicious activities.

- Network Traffic Analysis – Capturing and interpreting logs from IDS tools for network security insights.

 ### Tools Used

- Splunk Enterprise – For centralized log management, analysis, dashboards, and alerting (installed on Windows).

- Splunk Universal Forwarder – Lightweight log forwarder to send logs from Ubuntu VM to Splunk Enterprise.

- Snort IDS – Open-source Intrusion Detection System for monitoring and generating network security alerts.

- Ubuntu (Linux VM) – Host operating system for Snort and Splunk Universal Forwarder setup.

- Windows OS – Platform for hosting Splunk Enterprise server.

- kali linux - used this operating system as attacking machine to test the setup.

- VirtualBox  – For running the Ubuntu virtual machine and attacking machine (kali linux).

- Command Line Tools (Linux CLI) – For configuration, log viewing, and managing services in Ubuntu and to test the setup.

- Web Browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) – To access and manage the Splunk web interface.

  ### STEPS

  I’ll be installing and configuring Splunk’s universal forwarder, Snort in the ubuntu virtual machine as well as a Splunk enterpriser server in windows from scratch in the following steps
